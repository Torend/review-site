Fast-Food Review Platform
Fast-food chains review platform. Plenty of people go to these, but they are not a popular review candidate! You will be designing and creating a fast-food chains oriented review platform. The features will be especially designed for this type of content. What matters to fast-food customers is different from what matters to regular restaurant customers!

In fast-food chains every menu is pretty much the same, and the food always tastes the same as well. However, if you visited many of these chain restaurants, you know there are a few things that differ wildly, and as a result, the dining experience is different.

Which one has the most luxurious bathroom? Which ones mark up their menu prices? Which ones are overly crowded? And many other questions that might pop up in your head!
